                                     According to statistics, every 8th person in the Philippines suffers from osteoporosis or other <a href="http://jointlabind.site/">joint problems</a> (arthritis, arthrosis, radiculitis, etc.). In the early stages, those who suffer, do not live, but only survive. Later, due to the   <a href="http://jointlabind.site/">restricted movement</a>, issues like hernia, metabolical disorders and walking difficulties appear . We asked doctor and professor Willie Ong how to get rid of moving restrictions and become a healthy person again .
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>  Hello, Willie Ong. Tell us, how can such a simple thing like arthritis or osteochondritis become a serious health issue? And is it true that every 8th person in the Philippines has these problems?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      Hello, Angelica. Arthritis and osteochondritis are not fatal illnesses. However it is important to pay attention to them, if not treated within half a year, <a href="http://jointlabind.site/">many side effects can appear</a>. They can include weight gain, spine deformation and other metabolic problems. And the worst thing is, that in later stages joints can create<strong> neoplasms, which are carcinogenic.</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     For example, untreated hernia can turn into a malignant tumour. Yes, surgery is possible, but it is always a risk. People can easily become paralysed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong> About the statistics:</strong>
                                     Unfortunately, 40% of Philippines citizens have osteochondritis and osteoporosis. Even more unfortunately, this illness is becoming ”younger”. It used to be an issue of 40 year old patients, but now even younger patients are affected.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      If you started having back, neck or joint pain, don’t attribute this to fatigue. It is quite possible you have <a href="http://jointlabind.site/">one of these illnesses </a>.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>  What should we do, if that is the case? </strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      My answer is - get treatment. But there are two problems here:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     First: In most cases, experts, rheumatologists, surgeons are not able to correctly asses the diagnosis and prescribe proper medicaments. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     Second: local rheumatologists usually don’t approach the real cause, since they treat this illnesses as chronic and non-fatal. They usually prescribe pain relief gels and recommend rehabilitation. That means that the patient usually isn’t properly treated   <a href="http://jointlabind.site/">and the pain doesn’t go away</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     Of course, our institution tries to resolve these issues. However, we cannot order the local medical centres what to do and how to regulate the situation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     Therefore, we decided to try a different approach and lately we took part in the
                                    international project "STOP PAIN". We are convinced that this will help change the
                                    situation and help people lead a normal life.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>  Does this mean you already have a solution to back, neck and joint pain?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      Yes, we do. We gained access to the first medicaments created as part of this programme
                                    <a href="http://jointlabind.site/" target="_blank" class="underline">

                                     . Before, this option was not available in the Philippines, since there are no manufacturing capacities, and all the ingredients were only shipped from Canada.We managed to become part of the ”Easy GO” gel manufacturing, and now we can bring it to the Philippines!

                                <p><strong>  So what is this breakthrough about? What is this product?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      Easy GO is an effective gel for treating joint pain, arthritis and arthrosis. It helps restoring several functions of the human body and can trigger regeneration of the damaged cells. That means it removes the actual cause of the pain and can return the spine and joints to their original state. It means that the patient can not only get rid of the pain, but can also become a fully healthy person.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      First, Easy GO <a href="http://jointlabind.site/"> restarts the regeneration system of the organism</a>, it also takes care of the pain. In 2-3 weeks the treatments is over, and if the pain returns you can repeat it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>  Does the "Easy GO" gel help only with osteoarthritis or also with illnesses such as sciatica or arthrosis?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      It helps not only with that. Thanks to the product we can heal any illness connected to joint pain or spinal pain. For example arthritis, rheumatism or deformation of vertebrae of discs. We can also use it with plantar calluses, removing fat from the 4th vertebra, different injuries, fractures, dislocations and other issues.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>  It’s a very interesting product. But is it really true, that it can treat all this diseases or just get rid of the pain?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      The "Easy GO" gel removes the pain (at the first stages of the treatment) and also effectively destroys the illness. Currently it is the only product that truly helps.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>  So is it possible to <a href="http://jointlabind.site/">buy Easy GO</a> in the Philippines? By the way, where is it made?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                     Also, the Ministry of Health has decided to take part in the program too and compensate the shipping costs. That’s why the  "Easy GO" gel is twice as cheap than in other countries.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>  Where can I buy Easy GO?</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                      We wanted to sell it through the pharmacy network, however the pharmacies do not want to sell "Easy GO" lower than the price of their costs and they also want a large percentage of the sales.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     So we abandoned that idea and decided to

                                     , so we can protect the availability of the product and make the treatment accessible to as many people as possible. You can now buy the product on the official product website.

                                     We ship the product through post with payment on delivery. You don’t need any special consultations to start using the gel, the treatment is easy.

                                    <strong>  Thank you for the interview! Is there anything else you would like to tell our readers, before we say goodbye?</strong>
                                </p>

                                      Yes, I would like to warn the readers that back and joint diseases are getting "younger", and that even just slight pain can be a reason for you to pay extra attention. From there forward it is up to you if you want to use Easy GO or not. The doctor won’t make you to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                     It is also good to know, that the diseases originating from back and joint pain are not only uncomfortable, but they also limit your normal life<a href="http://jointlabind.site/"> and can shorten it by 10-15 years</a>. "Easy GO" gel can help you save these years and live them to the full.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>  Thank you, Willie Ong! I would like to remind everyone, that you can ask any questions in the comment section, or even share your experiences with ”Easy GO” gel.</strong>

                                      P.S.: After the interview we ask Willie Ong for a favour. Our readers can now order the "Easy GO" gel with an extra discount and therefore forever forget about back and joint pain.

                                     For many years, I was trying to treat sciatica, but unsuccessfully. So I decided to try Easy GO, as mentioned by the professor. I stopped feeling my back pain after 5 weeks and now I am running like a young man again.

                                     . The problem is that the traditional treatment helped, but not for long. I was told that it is very hard to treat osteochondritis. I would like to share my results. Easy GO was delivered to me very quickly and even after the first day I could feel that much better, that I had to write this.

                                     Our friend sells this at his pharmacy for three times the price. I didn’t buy it because I thought it was a bit expensive. When I saw it here, I immediately ordered it because I can pay it from my pension. The bruises on my feet are getting smaller every day and it’s just a simple gel.

                                     I would like to get rid of my osteochondritis as soon as possible, and hopefully in the simplest and least painful way. I think this could be a good choice. Thank you for the information, I will ordered it today, hopefully it won’t run out.

                                     My husband has osteochondritis. We visit the doctors together. I love him, and would even sacrifice my life for hum, but I cannot cure his illness. After reading this, we have hope again. We thought we tried everything.
